<br/>
 
A list of all need_id in the Needs table, with statuses and organizations assigned as mock-up data.  The statuses were assigned at random with 85 Completed, 10 Accepted, and 4 Received.

## Measures

TicketCount: Value passed to another measure.  A simple count of need_id to be used in context.

TopOrg: Value used as a flag in a filter to return the organization with the most need_id responded to.  The visual used separates by category.
